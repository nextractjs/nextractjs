# Enabling password protection of your analytics data

The Nextract.js dashboard is a great way to view your analytics data. But in some cases you might want some specific people to be able to view them.

Nextract.js offers a simple way to do this by enabling password protection.

## Update your Nextract.js API

To restrict access to your Nextract.js data, set up user account(s) in the API route configuration. Each user account has a username and a password.

Nextract.js will store a cookie in the user's browser to identify the user as logged in. Choose a password/secret that is **at least 32 characters long** and hard to guess and set it as the cookie password.

  **Pro tip:** For extra security and especially in open-source repositories make sure that you load the username,
  password and cookie password from [environment
  variables](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables).
