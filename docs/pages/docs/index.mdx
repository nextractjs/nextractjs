## The problem and our solution

These days, most other analytics solutions all have their pain-points. No matter which platform or provider you choose, in the end **you're the one who has to make trade-offs**.

- Google Analytics is [illegal in the EU](https://noyb.eu/en/austrian-dsb-eu-us-data-transfers-google-analytics-illegal) due to violations of the GDPR\*,
- Matomo Analytics is a pain to setup due to complex configurations of your on-premise infrastructure
- Most other solutions are costly

Take a look at our [detailed comparisons with other analytics solutions](/docs/compare) such as [Google Analytics](/docs/compare#google-analytics), [Matomo](/docs/compare#matomo) and [Plausible](/docs/compare#plausible) to see why Nextract.js is better for you.
